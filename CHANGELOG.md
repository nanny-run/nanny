## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-27

### Added

- **`[start]` config** — `nanny.toml` now accepts a `[start]` table with a `cmd` field.
  `nanny run` reads the command from config rather than requiring it on the CLI. Extra
  arguments passed after `--` are appended to the configured command.
- **`nanny::http_get`** — built-in SDK function that routes HTTP GET requests through the
  bridge. Enforced by the allowlist and rule system; costs 10 units on success.
- **`AgentScopeEntered` / `AgentScopeExited` events** — the event log now records when an
  agent enters or exits a named limits scope, including the limits active during that scope.
- **`ProcessCrashed` stop reason** — `ExecutionStopped` now distinguishes between a clean
  exit (`AgentCompleted`) and an unexpected non-zero exit (`ProcessCrashed`).
- **Async `#[agent]` support** — the `#[nanny::agent]` macro now correctly handles `async fn`
  decorated functions; the inner impl and call sites are generated as async.
- **`last_tool_args` in rule context** — rules now receive the arguments of the current
  tool call via `PolicyContext::last_tool_args`, enabling content-based enforcement.
- **Real-world sample apps** — two complete Rust agent samples using Ollama:
  - `examples/rust/webdingo` — web research agent (HTTP fetch + summarise)
  - `examples/rust/qabud` — codebase review agent (file tree + source analysis)
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** — developer design document covering the enforcement model,
  core abstractions, the direct-call pattern, stop reasons, and testing guidance.

### Fixed

- `ExecutionStopped` no longer emits `steps: 0` and `cost_spent: 0`. Step count and cost
  are now read from bridge metrics at process exit rather than hardcoded.
- `nanny run` prints the full `anyhow` error chain on failure (`:?#` formatting).
- Bridge `/stop` endpoint validates the reason string against the known set of stop reasons;
  an unknown reason from an untrusted child now maps to `ProcessCrashed`.
- `call_tool` now returns `Stop("BridgeUnavailable")` when the bridge is unreachable during
  a governed run, rather than silently allowing the tool call to proceed ungoverned.
- JSON arguments in `http_get`, `report_stop`, and `agent_enter` are now built with
  `serde_json::json!` instead of `format!`, preventing invalid JSON on special characters.
- `TimeoutExpired` added to the governance stop set, suppressing the misleading "0 tool
  calls" warning when execution ends due to timeout.
- `[start].cmd` is parsed with shell quoting rules (via `shlex`) so paths with spaces
  work correctly; unterminated quotes produce a clear error rather than a silent failure.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- Added `readme` field to `nannyd` crate manifest so the README displays on crates.io.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-26

First public release of Nanny — an execution boundary for autonomous AI agents.

### Added

- **`nanny init`** — scaffolds a `nanny.toml` with safe default limits in the current
  directory and prints a usage snippet.
- **`nanny run [--limits=<name>] <cmd>`** — runs any command (Python, Rust, Go, Node,
  or any binary) under enforcement. Hard limits on steps, cost units, and wall-clock
  time are checked before each step; the process is killed immediately on breach.
- **Named limits sets** — `[limits.<name>]` blocks in `nanny.toml` allow per-agent
  overrides; `--limits=researcher` activates one set for a single run.
- **Tool allowlist** — `[tools] allowed` in `nanny.toml` declares which tool names
  may be called; any unlisted tool call stops execution with `TOOL_DENIED`.
- **Rust SDK macros** —
  - `#[tool(cost = N)]` — wraps a free function as a governed tool; cost is charged
    and all registered rules are evaluated before the function body runs.
  - `#[rule("name")]` — registers a `fn(&PolicyContext) -> bool` enforcement rule
    evaluated before every tool call; returning `false` stops execution with `RULE_DENIED`.
  - `#[agent("name")]` — activates a named limits set for the duration of a function,
    reverting on exit (including panics).
- **Passthrough mode** — all macros are zero-overhead no-ops when `nanny run` is not
  active; the original function runs exactly as written.
- **Structured NDJSON event log** — append-only log with these event types:
  - `ExecutionStarted` — limits in effect and command, emitted once at the start.
  - `ToolAllowed` / `ToolDenied` / `ToolFailed` — per-tool-call audit trail.
  - `StepCompleted` — emitted after each step by the SDK bridge.
  - `ExecutionStopped` — final event with `reason`, steps, cost spent, and elapsed ms.
    Stop reasons: `AGENT_COMPLETED`, `MAX_STEPS_REACHED`, `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`,
    `TIMEOUT_EXPIRED`, `TOOL_DENIED`, `RULE_DENIED`, `MANUAL_STOP`.
- **Cross-platform binaries** — pre-built for macOS ARM, macOS Intel, and Linux x86_64,
  attached to each GitHub Release as `.tar.gz` archives.
- **curl installer** — `curl -fsSL https://install.nanny.run | sh` detects OS/arch
  and installs the `nanny` binary to `/usr/local/bin` or `~/.local/bin`.
- **Homebrew tap** — `brew tap nanny-run/nanny && brew install nannyd` via `nanny-run/nanny`.
- **CI** — GitHub Actions workflows for test, clippy, and cross-compiled release builds.
  SHA256 checksums for each binary are computed and pushed to the homebrew tap automatically
  on every tagged release.
